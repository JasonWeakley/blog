				JOPLIN, MO—Saying that even a small amount of the grain gives her trouble, local grandmother Gertrude Rogers, 84, announced Monday that corn has been added to the list of food items that upset her stomach. “Oh, I just can’t handle corn like I used to anymore,” said Rogers of the cereal plant, which has been identified along with broccoli, red meat, milk, peppers, legumes, cabbage, fettuccine Alfredo, dill pickles, honey glazed ham, nuts, fried shrimp, and pineapple as a food she should avoid, especially after 7 p.m. “You go ahead and enjoy. I’ll be just fine with the brown rice and some squash.” At press time, Rogers confirmed that the squash was starting to make her feel “a little green around the gills.” <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/corn-added-list-items-upset-grandmas-stomach-52122">Read more...</a>

				GENEVA—Explaining that fatalities attributable to such afflictions had become prevalent among a wide variety of populations across the globe, the World Health Organization announced Wednesday that the group had added gunfire and explosions to its official list of natural causes of death. “As we compile data going forward, any individual whose death results from a mass shooting, bombing, or any combination of the two will be considered as having succumbed to natural causes,” said WHO director-general Margaret Chan, noting that fatal wounds caused by bullets, shrapnel, and other ricocheting debris would be counted alongside heart disease, organ failure, and other age-associated diseases as natural threats to the human body. <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/world-health-organization-adds-gunfire-explosions--52124">Read more...</a>

				KENAI, AK—Sitting on a rock atop the powerful, churning rapids, a grizzly bear reportedly caught Michael Phelps in its jaws Tuesday as the sexually mature Olympian leaped out of the water while swimming upstream to spawn. “The grizzly was waiting patiently and just snatched Phelps right out of the air when he launched from the water—it was so majestic,” said eyewitness Robert Simon, adding that the massive bear gorged on the protein-rich 18-time Olympic gold medal winner. “Phelps managed to wriggle free for a second and was flopping around like crazy, but the grizzly stunned him smashing his body against the rocks. And then the bear just ripped open Phelps’ belly with its claws.” At press time, the grizzly’s two cubs were fighting over the last few scraps of the 6’4” competitive swimmer. <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/grizzly-bear-catches-spawning-michael-phelps-jaws-52119">Read more...</a>
